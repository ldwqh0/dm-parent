/**
 * <p>
 * Synonym for &#64;Controller but only used for endpoints provided by the
 * framework (so it never clashes with user's own endpoints defined with
 * &#64;Controller). Use with &#64;RequestMapping and all the other
 * &#64;Controller features (and match with a
 * {@link FrameworkEndpointHandlerMapping} in the servlet context).
 * </p>
 * 
 * <p>
 * Users of the Spring Security OAuth2 XSD namespace need not use this feature
 * explicitly as the relevant handlers will be registered by the parsers.
